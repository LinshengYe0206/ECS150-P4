<li>The reference work environment is the CSIF.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="specifications"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Specifications</h1>
<p><em>Note that the specifications for this project are subject to change at anytime for additional clarification. Make sure to always refer to the <strong>latest</strong> version.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to implement the support of a very simple file system, <strong>ECS150-FS</strong>. This file system is based on a FAT (File Allocation Table) and supports up to 128 files in a single root directory.</p>
<p>The file system is implemented on top of a virtual disk. This virtual disk is actually a simple binary file that is stored on the “real” file system provided by your computer.</p>
<p>Exactly like real hard drives which are split into sectors, the virtual disk is logically split into blocks. The first software layer involved in the file system implementation is the <em>block API</em> and is provided to you. This block API is used to open or close a virtual disk, and read or write entire blocks from it.</p>
<p>Above the block layer, the <em>FS layer</em> is in charge of the actual file system management. Through the FS layer, you can mount a virtual disk, list the files that are part of the disk, add or delete new files, read from files or write to files, etc.</p>
<h3 id="constraints"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Constraints</h3>
<p>Your library must be written in C, be compiled with GCC and only use the standard functions provided by the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/">GNU C Library</a> (aka <code>libc</code>). <em>All</em> the functions provided by the <code>libc</code> can be used, but your program cannot be linked to any other external libraries.</p>
<p>Your source code should follow the relevant parts of the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html">Linux kernel coding style</a> and be properly commented.</p>
<h3 id="skeleton-code"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Skeleton code</h3>
<p>The skeleton code that you are expected to complete is available in <code>/home/cs150/public/p4</code>. This code already defines most of the prototypes for the functions you must implement, as explained in the following sections.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> /home/cs150/public/p4
<span class="gp">$</span> tree
<span class="go">.</span>
<span class="go">├── libfs</span>
<span class="go">│   ├── disk.c</span>
<span class="go">│   ├── disk.h</span>
<span class="go">│   ├── fs.c*</span>

<span class="go">└── test</span>
<span class="go">    ├── Makefile</span>
<span class="go">    └── test_fs.c</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The code is organized in two parts.</p>
<p>In the subdirectory <code>test</code>, there is one test application that you can use and enhance to your needs.</p>
<p>In the subdirectory <code>libfs</code>, there are the files composing the file-system library that you must complete. The files to complete are marked with a star (you should have <strong>no</strong> reason to touch any of the headers which are not marked with a star, even if you think you do…).</p>
<h2 id="phase-0-the-ecs150-fs-specification"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Phase 0: the ECS150-FS specification</h2>
<p>For this project, the specification for a very simple file system has been defined: it’s the <strong>ECS150-FS</strong> file system.</p>
<p>The layout of ECS150-FS on a disk is composed of four consecutive logical parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Superblock</em> is the very first block of the disk and contains information about the file system (number of blocks, size of the FAT, etc.)</li>
<li>The <em>File Allocation Table</em> is located on one or more blocks, and keeps track of both the free data blocks and the mapping between files and the data blocks holding their content.</li>
<li>The <em>Root directory</em> is in the following block and contains an entry for each file of the file system, defining its name, size and the location of the first data block for this file.</li>
<li>Finally, all the remaining blocks are <em>Data blocks</em> and are used by the content of files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of virtual disk blocks is <strong>4096 bytes</strong>.</p>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, all values in this specification are <em>unsigned</em> and the order of multi-bytes values is <em>little-endian</em>.</p>
<h3 id="superblock"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Superblock</h3>
<p>The superblock is the first block of the file system. Its internal format is:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Offset</th>
<th>Length (bytes)</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0x00</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>Signature (must be equal to “ECS150FS”)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0x08</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Total amount of blocks of virtual disk</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0x0A</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Root directory block index</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0x0C</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Data block start index</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0x0E</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Amount of data blocks</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0x10</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Number of blocks for FAT</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0x11</td>
<td>4079</td>
<td>Unused/Padding</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If one creates a file system with 8192 data blocks, the size of the FAT will be 8192 x 2 = 16384 bytes long, thus spanning 16384 / 4096 = 4 blocks. The root directory block index will therefore be 5, because before it there are the superblock (block index #0) and the FAT (starting at block index #1 and spanning 4 blocks). The data block start index will be 6, because it’s located right after the root directory block. The total amount of blocks for such a file system would then be 1 + 4 + 1 + 8192 = 8198.</p>
<h3 id="fat"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> FAT</h3>
<p>The FAT is a flat array, possibly spanning several blocks, which entries are composed of 16-bit unsigned words. There are as many entries as <em>data blocks</em> in the disk.</p>
<p>The first entry of the FAT (entry #0) is always invalid and contains the special <code>FAT_EOC</code> (<em>End-of-Chain</em>) value which is <code>0xFFFF</code>. Entries marked as 0 correspond to free data blocks. Entries containing a positive value are part of a chainmap and represent a link to the next block in the chainmap.</p>
<p>Note that although the numbering in the FAT starts at 0, entry contents must be added to the data block start index in order to find the real block number on disk.</p>
<p>The following table shows an example of a FAT containing two files:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first file is of length 18,000 bytes (thus spanning 5 data blocks) and is contained in consecutive data blocks (DB#2, DB#3, DB#4, DB#5 and DB#6).</li>
<li>The second file is of length 5,000 bytes (this spanning 2 data blocks) and its content is fragmented in two non-consecutive data blocks (DB#1 and DB#8).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each entry in the FAT is 16-bit wide.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>FAT index:</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>6</th>
<th>7</th>
<th>8</th>
<th>9</th>
<th>10</th>
<th>…</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Content:</td>
<td>0xFFFF</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>0xFFFF</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0xFFFF</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="root-directory"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Root directory</h3>
<p>The root directory is an array of 128 entries stored in the block following the FAT. Each entry is 32-byte wide and describes a file, according to the following format:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Offset</th>
<th>Length (bytes)</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0x00</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>Filename (including NULL character)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0x10</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>Size of the file (in bytes)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0x14</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>Index of the first data block</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0x16</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>Unused/Padding</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>An empty entry is defined by the first character of the entry’s filename being equal to the NULL character.</p>
<p>The entry for an empty file, which doesn’t have any data blocks, would have its size be 0, and the index of the first data block be <code>FAT_EOC</code>.</p>
<p>Continuing the previous example, let’s assume that the first file is named “test1” and the second file “test2”. Let’s also assume that there is an empty file named “test3”. The content of the root directory would be:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Filename (16 bytes)</th>
<th>Size (4 bytes)</th>
<th>Index (2 bytes)</th>
<th>Padding (10 bytes)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>test1\0</td>
<td>18000</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>xxx</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td>1</td>
<td>xxx</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>test3\0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td><code>FAT_EOC</code></td>
<td>xxx</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>\0</td>

<h3 id="formatting-program"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Formatting program</h3>
<p>A FS formatter is provided to you in <code>/home/cs150/public/p4/fs_make.x</code>. The purpose of this program is to create a new virtual disk and initialize an empty file system on it.</p>
<p>It accepts two arguments: the name of the virtual disk image and the number of data blocks to create:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> ./fs_make.x disk.fs <span class="m">4096</span>
<span class="go">Created virtual disk 'disk.fs' with '4096' data blocks</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that this formatter can not create a file-system of more than 8192 data blocks (which already makes a 33MB virtual disk).</p>
<h3 id="reference-program-and-testing"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.5</span> Reference program and testing</h3>
<p>A reference program is provided to you in <code>/home/cs150/public/p4/fs_ref.x</code>. This program accepts multiple commands (one per run) and allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get some information about a virtual disk: <code>fs_ref.x info &lt;diskname&gt;</code></li>
<li>List all the files contained in a virtual disk: <code>fs_ref.x ls &lt;diskname&gt;</code></li>
<li>Etc.</li>
<li>In order to have the list of commands: <code>fs_ref.x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The code of this executable is actually provided to you in <code>test_fs.c</code> and you will have to implement the complete API that this program uses. The creation of new virtual disks is the only tasks that you don’t have to program yourself as it is provided by <code>fs_make.x</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise your implementation should generate the same output as the reference program, and the manipulations that are performed on the virtual disk should be understood by both the reference program and your implementation. For example, after creating a virtual disk, the output of the command <code>info</code> from the reference program should match exactly the output from your implementation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> ./fs_make.x disk.fs <span class="m">8192</span>
<span class="go">Creating virtual disk 'disk.fs' with '8192' data blocks</span>
<span class="gp">$</span> ./fs_ref.x info disk.fs &gt; ref_output
<span class="gp">$</span> ./test_fs.x info disk.fs &gt; my_output
<span class="gp">$</span> diff ref_output my_output
<span class="gp">$</span>
</pre></div>

<h2 id="phase-1-mountingunmounting"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Phase 1: Mounting/unmounting</h2>
<p>In this first phase, you must implement the function <code>fs_mount()</code> and <code>fs_umount()</code>.</p>
<p><code>fs_mount()</code> makes the file system contained in the specified virtual disk “ready to be used”. You need to open the virtual disk, using the block API, and load the meta-information that is necessary to handle the file system operations described in the following phases. <code>fs_umount()</code> makes sure that the virtual disk is properly closed and that all the internal data structures of the FS layer are properly cleaned.</p>
<p>For this phase, you should probably start by defining the data structures corresponding to the blocks containing the meta-information about the file system (superblock, FAT and root directory).</p>
<p>In order to correctly describe these data structures, you will probably need to use the integer types defined in <code>stdint.h</code>, such as <code>int8_t</code>, <code>uint8_t</code>, <code>uint16_t</code>, etc. Also, when describing your data structures and in order to avoid the compiler to interfere with their layout, it’s always good practice to attach the attribute <code>packed</code> to these data structures.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that your function <code>fs_mount()</code> should perform some error checking in order to verify that the file system has the expected format. For example, the signature of the file system should correspond to the one defined by the specification, the total amount of block should correspond to what <code>block_disk_count()</code> returns, etc.</p>
<p>Once you’re able to mount a file system, you can implement the function <code>fs_info()</code> which prints some information about the mounted file system and make sure that the output corresponds exactly to the reference program.</p>
<p>It is important to observe that the file system must provide persistent storage. Let’s assume that you have created a file system on a virtual disk and mounted it. Then, you create a few files and write some data to them. Finally, you unmount the file system. At this point, all data must be written onto the virtual disk. Another application that mounts the file system at a later point in time must see the previously created files and the data that was written. This means that whenever <code>umount_fs()</code> is called, all meta-information and file data must have been written out to disk.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2-file-creationdeletion"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Phase 2: File creation/deletion</h2>
<p>In this second phase, you must implement <code>fs_create()</code> and <code>fs_delete()</code> which add or remove files from the file system.</p>
<p>In order to add a file, you need to find an empty entry in the root directory and fill it out with the proper information. At first, you only need to specify the name of the file and reset the other information since there is no content at this point. The size should be set to 0 and the first index on the data blocks should be set to <code>FAT_EOC</code>.</p>
<p>Removing a file is the opposite procedure: the file’s entry must be emptied and all the data blocks containing the file’s contents must be freed in the FAT.</p>
<p>Once you’re able to add and remove files, you can implement the function <code>fs_ls()</code> which prints the listing of all the files in the file system. Make sure that the output corresponds exactly to the reference program.</p>
<h2 id="phase-3-file-descriptor-operations"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Phase 3: File descriptor operations</h2>
<p>In order for applications to manipulate files, the FS API offers functions which are very similar to the Linux file system operations. <code>fs_open()</code> opens a file and returns a <em>file descriptor</em> which can then be used for subsequent operations on this file (reading, writing, changing the file offset, etc). <code>fs_close()</code> closes a file descriptor.</p>
<p>Your library must support a maximum of 32 file descriptors that can be open simultaneously. The same file (i.e. file with the same name) can be opened multiple times, in which case <code>fs_open()</code> must return multiple independent file descriptors.</p>
<p>A file descriptor is associated to a file and also contains a <em>file offset</em>. The file offset indicates the current reading/writing position in the file. It is implicitly incremented whenever a read or write is performed, or can be explicitly set by <code>fs_lseek()</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the function <code>fs_stat()</code> must return the size of the file corresponding to the specified file descriptor. To append to a file, one can, for example, call <code>fs_lseek(fd, fs_stat(fd));</code>.</p>
<h2 id="phase-4-file-readingwriting"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Phase 4: File reading/writing</h2>
<p>In the last phase, you must implement <code>fs_read()</code> and <code>fs_write()</code> which respectively read from and write to a file.</p>
<p>It is advised to start with <code>fs_read()</code> which is slightly easier to program. You can use the reference program to write a file in a disk image, which you can then read using your implementation.</p>
<p>For these functions, you will probably need a few helper functions. For example, you will need a function that returns the index of the data block corresponding to the file’s offset. For writing, in the case the file has to be extended in size, you will need a function that allocates a new data block and link it at the end of the file’s data block chain. Note that the allocation of new blocks should follow the <em>first-fit</em> strategy (first block available from the beginning of the FAT).</p>
<p>When reading or writing a certain number of bytes from/to a file, you will also need to deal properly with possible “mismatches” between the file’s current offset, the amount of bytes to read/write, the size of blocks, etc.</p>
<p>For example, let’s assume a reading operation for which the file’s offset is not aligned to the beginning of the block or the amount of bytes to read doesn’t span the whole block. You will probably need to read the entire block into a <em>bounce</em> buffer first, and then copy only the right amount of bytes from the bounce buffer into the user-supplied buffer.</p>
<p>The same scenario for a writing operation would slightly trickier. You will probably need to first read the block from disk, then modify only the part starting from the file’s offset with the user-supplied buffer, before you can finally write the dirty block back to the disk.</p>
<p>These special cases happen mostly for small reading/writing operations, or at the beginning or end of a big operation. In big operations (spanning multiple blocks), offsets and sizes are perfectly aligned for all the middle blocks and the procedure is then quite simple, as blocks can be read or written entirely.</p>
